# Notis

Using the official data regarding public notary entities and authorized translators + interpreters, we are developing a smart modular Web system capable to provide support for locating offices and services – such as notarized documents: acknowledgments, oaths/affirmations, copy certification, signature witnessing, others legal procedures – according to user preferences, geographical places, fees, restrictions, and other aspects (e.g., support for foreign citizens). 

Via SPARQL endpoints, the application will offer useful maps and additional knowledge (contact info, timetable, reviews, related points of interest) about each notary office.
